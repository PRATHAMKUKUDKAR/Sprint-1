## Walkthrough of Frontend
To get started with the attendance API POC, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```sh
    git clone https://github.com/OT-MICROSERVICES/frontend.git
    cd frontend
```
The first command clones the frontend repository on your machine. while the second command is to change the directory to frontend.

2. **Edit the package.json file:**
Here, in `package.json` file, change the ip-address with your public ip-address in the proxy with valid port.

3.**Add the NodeSource repository:**
To install Node.js 16, add the NodeSource PPA (personal package archive) for Node.js 16
```sh
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
```
This command adds the Node.js repository (NodeSource) to the system's package sources and configures it for Node.js version 16.x.

4. **Install nodejs:**
```sh 
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nodejs -y
```
The first command updates the package index of the local APT package repository, ensuring that the latest versions of packages are available for installation.
Installs Node.js on the system. The '-y' flag automatically confirms any prompts during the installation process, allowing it to proceed without user intervention.

5. **Building the application:**
For building the application. we can use make command from the Makefile. The command is as follows. But before that we to install make command if not there.
```sh
    sudo apt install make
    make build
```
The first command is used to install make, which is used to build automation tool. The second command is the make build which indirectly runs npm install command through it.

6. **For Running the application:**
The command for running the application the command is as follows.
```sh
    npm start
```
Executes the "start" script defined in the package.json file. This typically starts the development server or runs the application in a development environment.

7. Now,go to the browser and hit your public ip address with port 3000 to see the frontend user interface.
```sh
    http://<Public-ip-address>:3000
```

8. **Output:**
Finally the output from running the above Command is given below
