## Introduction
Full Stack Development is a crucial skill set in today's technology-driven world. It involves working on both the front end and back end of applications, allowing developers to build complete, functional web applications from start to finish.

## What is Full Stack Development?
Full Stack Development encompasses the development of both the front end (client side) and the back end (server side) of web applications. Front-end technologies typically include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while back-end technologies can include languages like Node.js, Python, Ruby, and databases like MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL.

## Why Learn Full Stack Development?

| Benefit                     | Description                                                                                             |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Versatility**             | Full Stack Developers have the flexibility to work on various parts of a project, increasing their employability. |
| **Comprehensive Understanding** | Learning both front-end and back-end technologies provides a holistic view of application development.  |
| **Increased Demand**        | As more companies seek developers who can handle both sides of development, Full Stack skills are increasingly sought after. |


## When to Use Full Stack Development?

| Ideal Use Case      | Description                                                                                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Startups**        | Where resources may be limited and developers need to wear multiple hats.                    |
| **Freelancing**     | Providing a wide range of services to clients, from design to deployment.                    |
| **Rapid Prototyping** | Building MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) quickly to test ideas and gather feedback.         |
 
 ## Use of Full Stack in our project
  In our project we use Full Stack to make a user friendly Interface for our API's that we recently worked for.

## Where we used Full Stack

 We use Full Stack to make/build a GUI with the combination of Backend & Frontend . This makes a final result  for our [OT-Microservices](https://github.com/OT-MICROSERVICES/) to make a Full stack application.


## Database Technology


| Database    | Purpose                                       | Description                                                  | **More Detals**
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------| ---|
| **PostgreSQL** | Relational Database                           | A powerful, open-source relational database system with advanced  features like ACID compliance and support for complex queries. Ideal for structured data and transactional applications. | [Link](https://www.postgresql.org/) 
| **ScyllaDB**  | NoSQL Database                                | A high-performance NoSQL database that is compatible with Apache Cassandra. It is designed for scalability and low latency, suitable for handling large volumes of unstructured data. |  [Link](https://www.scylladb.com/)
| **Redis**     | In-memory Data Store                          | An open-source, in-memory key-value store known for its speed. Often used for caching, session management, and real-time analytics. | [Link](https://redis.io/)
