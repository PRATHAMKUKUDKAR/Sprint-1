### Key Concepts
| Term               | Description                                                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|      **Database**    | A collection of related data objects like tables, views, and functions.          |
|     **Schema**       | A logical grouping of database objects within a database.                        |
| **Table**     | A structured collection of data records with rows and columns.         |
| **Column**    | A named attribute of a table that holds specific data types like integers, text, or timestamps.       |
|   **Row**     | A single instance of data in a table, containing values for each column.      |
| **SQL (Structured Query Language)**    | A standardized language for querying and manipulating data in relational databases.  |
| **Indexes**    | Data structures that improve query performance by speeding up data retrieval.           |
| **Constraints**    | Rules that enforce data integrity by restricting the type or format of data allowed in a table.  |

### Creating and Managing a PostgreSQL Database
| **Rule** | **Description**  |
|----------|------------------|
| **Installation**| Use the [Postgresql POC](https://github.com/MyGurukulam-p11/Documentation/tree/main/OT-Microservices/Softaware/Postgresql/POC) for installation of PostgreSQL.
|**Database Creation** | Use the CREATE DATABASE command to create a new database instance.|
| **Schema Definition** | Design your database schema by defining tables, columns, data types, and relationships between tables.|
| **Data Manipulation** | Use SQL commands like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE to insert, modify, and remove data from tables.|
| **User Management**| Create users and assign them appropriate access privileges to secure your database.|
| **Backups and Recovery** |Regularly back up your database to ensure data is recoverable in case of failures.            |
