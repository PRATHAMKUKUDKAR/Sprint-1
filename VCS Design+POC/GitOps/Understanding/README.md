## Introduction
   GitOps is a methodology that leverages Git as a single source of truth for infrastructure and application deployments. GitOps tools automate the deployment, management, and monitoring of infrastructure and applications using Git repositories as the central control plane. In this document, we will evaluate various GitOps tools, discussing their features, advantages, and limitations, and provide a comparison in tabular form.


## What is Gitops

Gitops is the basically a devops practice but with git repositories , it means taking git repositories as the single source of truth , now as the name suggest it has two things in it , git for version control and ops for operation that we are going to perform using that .

So gitops is a devops practice where we first have IAC ( infrastructure as code ) , it can be in terraform , ansible or Kubernetes , and then using gitops tools we manage , configure  and deploy the infra . 


## Why do we use Gitops 

- Without GitOps, deploying Terraform code from a local system creates integration issues among team members.
- Risks of pushing untested code directly to the main branch increase, potentially causing infrastructure problems.
- Lack of automated testing means higher chances of errors.
- GitOps automates infrastructure tasks like testing and deployment, and enforces branching strategies.
- Improves collaboration, reduces errors, and enhances deployment reliability.

## Gitops principles

| Principle                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Declarative Descriptions                       | Use declarative descriptions to define the desired state of the system. This means the entire system state is described using code. Tools like Kubernetes manifests, Terraform scripts, or Ansible playbooks specify what the infrastructure should look like, not how to achieve that state. |
| Version Control as the Single Source of Truth  | Use Git as the single source of truth for the desired state. This ensures that the entire system state is versioned, auditable, and easily revertible.                                                                         |
| Automated Workflows                            | Automate the application of the desired state to the infrastructure. Tools continuously monitor the Git repository for changes and apply them to the infrastructure.                                                           |
| Rollbacks                                      | Easily rollback to previous states if issues arise. This ensures that any deployment or configuration change can be reversed quickly and safely.                                                                               |

## GitOps Workflows and Procedures

| **Stage**         | **Description**                                                                                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **IAC (Infrastructure as Code)** | First, define the code that you want to deploy, whether it is Terraform, Ansible, or Kubernetes. |
| **Git Commit**    | Commit the code to the Git repository.                                                                   |
| **CI/CD**         | Deploy the code continuously using CI tools for GitOps like Argo CD.                                  |
| **Keeps Track of Code** | If the code in the Git repository changes (e.g., updating a Docker image in Kubernetes), Argo CD will automatically pull the changes and redeploy the updated code. |

## Benefit of Gitops

| Feature       | Description                                                                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Automation    | With GitOps, complete deployment of infrastructure is automated, minimizing manual intervention and reducing the risk of errors.                                   |
| Version Control | Git serves as the foundation in GitOps, providing complete control over versioning of code, enabling easy tracking of changes, and facilitating rollbacks in case of issues. |
| Consistency   | GitOps ensures consistency across different environments (e.g., staging, production, development) by defining configuration settings in Git repositories, thereby avoiding manual configuration issues. |
| Security      | Access to Git repositories is controlled, allowing only authorized users to make changes, enhancing security.                                                  |
| Testing       | GitOps integrates with CI/CD pipelines, enabling the integration of testing tools to prevent errors.                                                            |


## Drawbacks of GitOps

| Concern                                     | Description                                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Learning Curve                              | The learning curve for GitOps tools is steep. Users need to understand the functionalities of each tool, integrate them into their workflow, and then learn how to use them effectively. |
| Complexity                                  | Setting up a GitOps workflow involves configuring Git repositories, CI/CD pipelines, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools. Managing these components can be complex and requires a deep understanding of various technologies. |
| Latency                                     | GitOps workflows rely on Git commits to trigger deployments, which can introduce latency. The time it takes to commit changes, run CI/CD pipelines, and apply changes to the infrastructure can slow down the deployment process. |
| Limited Support for Non-Git Configurations | GitOps heavily relies on Git for configuration management. Environments or systems that do not use Git may find it challenging to integrate GitOps practices. |
| Dependency on CI/CD Pipeline Stability     | GitOps heavily depends on the stability of CI/CD pipelines to automate deployments. Any instability or issues within these pipelines can directly impact the deployment process. |

## FAQ'S

### How does GitOps differ from traditional DevOps?

DevOps provides a holistic approach to software development and operations, emphasizing collaboration and automation across the entire lifecycle. On the other hand, GitOps narrows its focus to continuous delivery and deployment, leveraging Git as the single source of truth for configuration management
