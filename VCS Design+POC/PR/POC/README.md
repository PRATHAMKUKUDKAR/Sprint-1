## Introduction
A Pull Request (PR) is a feature in Git-based systems that lets developers propose, review, and discuss code changes before merging them into the main branch. It ensures collaboration, code quality, and a clear change audit trail.

## Why Use Pull Requests?

### Feature Description

| **Feature**      | **Description**                                                                                                                                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Code Review**  | Pull Requests facilitate code reviews by enabling team members to review, comment, and suggest improvements on changes before they are merged, which helps catch potential issues early and ensures high-quality code. |
| **Collaboration**| PRs encourage collaboration by allowing multiple developers to work on different features or fixes in parallel, making it easier to integrate their work into the main codebase. |
| **Accountability**| Since each PR is linked to a specific author and reviewed by others, it provides a clear record of who made changes and who approved them, promoting accountability within the team. |
| **Version Control**| PRs streamline the process of managing and merging changes, preventing conflicts by providing a structured approach to integrating code. |
| **Documentation**| Every PR includes a description of the changes made, which serves as valuable documentation for the team to understand the evolution of the project over time. |


## What is a Pull Request?
A Pull Request (PR) is a request to merge changes from one branch (typically a feature or bug-fix branch) into another, usually the main or development branch. It serves as a way to propose changes to a codebase, allowing team members to review the code before it is merged. When a developer completes a task or feature, they create a PR, which includes a summary of the changes made, such as new features, bug fixes, or code improvements. The PR then undergoes a review process, where other team members can comment, request changes, and approve or reject the proposed updates. Once the PR is approved, the changes are merged into the base branch, ensuring that only thoroughly reviewed and tested code is integrated into the main project.

## Workflow of a Pull Request

## PR Creation Steps
1. **Create a Branch**

   First, make a new branch from the main or development branch to work on a specific feature or fix. Name the branch clearly, like `feature/add-login`.
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/add-login
   ```

2. **Make Changes**

    Now, add the necessary changes in your code (e.g., adding a login feature). After that, add the files you changed to the staging area.
    ```
    git add .
    ```
3. **Commit Changes**

    Save your changes with a clear message. The message should explain what feature or fix youâ€™ve added.
    ```
    git commit -m "added functionality"
    ```

4. **Push the Branch**

    Push your branch to the remote repository so others can see and review it.
    ```
    git push origin feature/add-login
    ```
5. **Open a Pull Request**

    Go to your project on GitHub or GitLab and open a new pull request. Choose your branch and the branch you want to merge it into (usually main or development). Add a short description of the changes.

6. **Request Reviews and Fix Comments**

    Ask your team members to review your PR. If they suggest changes, make them and update the PR.

7. **Merge the Pull Request**

    Once your PR is approved, merge it into the main branch. Use squash and merge to keep your project history clean.
